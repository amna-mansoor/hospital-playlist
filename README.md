# 🏥 Hospital Appointment & Bed Allocation System

A full-stack hospital management system built to demonstrate **concurrency-safe scheduling** — the kind of double-booking, race-condition, and resource-contention problem that shows up in real distributed systems, not just CRUD forms.

Patients book appointments against live doctor availability, admins manage departments/beds/doctors, and doctors run their day from a live dashboard — all while the system guarantees, at the database level, that two people can never be assigned the same appointment slot or the same hospital bed.

##  Features

- **Conflict-free appointment booking** — optimistic locking (`@Version`) plus a database-level `UNIQUE(doctor_id, slot_start)` constraint means a double-booking is not just unlikely, it's structurally impossible, even under concurrent load.
- **Bed & ward allocation** — pessimistic row-locking (`PESSIMISTIC_WRITE`) safely assigns the next free bed when two receptionists admit patients into the same department at the same instant. Live occupancy view (e.g. *"ICU: 8/10 occupied"*).
- **Waitlist queue** — if a doctor's day is fully booked, patients join a waitlist and get auto-emailed the moment a cancellation frees up a slot.
- **Role-based access** — JWT authentication with `PATIENT`, `DOCTOR`, `RECEPTIONIST`, and `ADMIN` roles, each with a purpose-built dashboard.
- **Doctor dashboard** — today's schedule on a FullCalendar view, patient history, mark visits as completed/no-show.
- **Admin analytics dashboard** — department load, doctor utilization %, peak booking hours, and live bed occupancy, all charted with Recharts.
- **Automated email notifications** — booking confirmations, 24-hour appointment reminders (`@Scheduled` cron job), and waitlist alerts, sent via Gmail SMTP.
- **Audit trail** — every cancellation, reschedule, and status change is logged with who did it and when.

##  Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Java 17, Spring Boot 3 (Web, Data JPA, Validation, Security) |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Neon / Supabase free tier) |
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite, FullCalendar, Recharts, Axios |
| Auth | Spring Security + JWT (role-based: Patient / Doctor / Receptionist / Admin) |
| Email | Gmail SMTP (app password) |
| CI | GitHub Actions (runs the JUnit test suite on every push) |
| Deployment | Render (backend), Vercel/Netlify (frontend) — no Docker required |

##  The concurrency problem this project solves

Two patients click "book" on the exact same doctor + time slot within milliseconds of each other. What happens?

1. Both requests read the slot as free.
2. Whichever request's `INSERT` reaches Postgres first wins and creates the appointment row.
3. The **`UNIQUE(doctor_id, slot_start)` constraint** on the `appointments` table means the second `INSERT` is physically rejected by the database itself — not just caught by application logic that could theoretically be raced around.
4. The losing request gets a clean `409 Conflict` — *"This slot was just booked. Please choose another time."* — instead of a silent double-booking or an ugly crash.

Beds use a deliberately different strategy: since beds are a scarcer, more contended resource, `BedRepository` uses `@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)` so the second admission request simply **waits its turn** on the database row rather than failing and retrying. Two different flavors of the same underlying problem, solved with the right tool for each — see `AppointmentService.java` and `BedService.java` for the full comments.

##  Database design

Core tables: `users`, `patients`, `doctors`, `departments`, `appointments`, `beds`, `admissions`, `waitlist`, `audit_logs`.

- Foreign keys tie appointments/admissions back to patients, doctors, and departments.
- `UNIQUE(doctor_id, slot_start)` on `appointments` prevents double-booking at the schema level.
- Indexes on `(doctor_id, slot_start)` and `patient_id` keep slot lookups and history queries fast as data grows.
- `@Version` columns on `appointments` and `beds` back the optimistic-locking strategy described above.

##  Getting started

This repo includes **[SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md)** — a complete, step-by-step walkthrough written for someone who has never set up a dev project before. It covers installing every tool, creating free cloud accounts (Neon, Render, Vercel, Gmail), running the app locally, and deploying it live for free. Start there.

**Quick start, if you already have Java 17, Maven, Node, and a Postgres database ready:**

\`\`\`bash
# Backend
cd backend
export DB_URL="jdbc:postgresql://<your-neon-host>/neondb?sslmode=require"
export DB_USERNAME="<your-db-username>"
export DB_PASSWORD="<your-db-password>"
export JWT_SECRET="<a-long-random-string>"
export GMAIL_USERNAME="<your-gmail-address>"
export GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="<your-gmail-app-password>"
mvn spring-boot:run
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # set VITE_API_BASE_URL if not localhost:8080
npm run dev
\`\`\`

---

##  Testing & CI

\`\`\`bash
cd backend
mvn test
\`\`\`

Runs against an in-memory H2 database (see `src/test/resources/application.properties`), so no real Postgres connection is needed for CI. `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` runs this automatically on every push and pull request via GitHub Actions.
